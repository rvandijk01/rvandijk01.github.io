# My Personal Website

This is the public version of Remco van Dijk's personal website made using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) tool along with the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme. The theme is subject to change as I'm currently not quite satisfied with the look and feel of the website.

This public repository only contains the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code generated by the Hugo tool. I use a private repository to version the original source files (Markdown + configs). This repository is configured as a submodule for the private one.
